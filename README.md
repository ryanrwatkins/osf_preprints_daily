# osf_preprints_daily
Like www.arXiv.com, the Center for Open Science's www.osf.io/preprints is a great resource for keeping up with the latest in science.  Whereas arXiv is focuses on preprint papers in the STEM sciences, the OSF preprint service focuses more on the social sciences. For arXiv there is a great tool, www.arXivist.com the provides a daily email (or RSS feed) of new additions to the arXiv database (including a recommendation engine to help you follow your favorite topics -- which is quite helpful since 100s of papers get added daily on arXiv). The OSF preprint service doesn't get the volume of preprint articles, but here is a simple script to create a daily email (and RSS feed) to get new preprints dded to the OSF repository. A recommendation engine could be added if the number of submissions goes up, for now this probably does enough.
