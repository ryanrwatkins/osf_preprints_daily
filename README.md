# osf_preprints_daily Python
Like www.arXiv.com, the Center for Open Science's www.osf.io/preprints is a great resource for keeping up with the latest in science.  Whereas arXiv is focuses on preprint papers in the STEM sciences, the OSF preprint service focuses more on the social sciences. For arXiv there is a great tool, www.arXivist.com the provides a daily email (or RSS feed) of new additions to the arXiv database (including a recommendation engine to help you follow your favorite topics -- which is quite helpful since 100s of papers get added daily on arXiv). The OSF preprint service doesn't get near that volume of preprint articles, so here is a simple script to create a daily email (and RSS feed) to get new preprints added to the OSF repository the day before. A recommendation engine could be added if the number of submissions goes up, for now this probably does enough (e.g., after trimming out a few fields that that are less interest to me, I get about 20 to 25 new preprint article listings most days).
